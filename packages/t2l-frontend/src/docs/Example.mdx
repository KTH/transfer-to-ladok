# Transfer to Ladok API

Welcome to Transfer to Ladok API documentation.

Transfer to Ladok API is a REST-ful API maintained by e-lärande team at KTH that you can use to read grades (omdöme) from an examroom or courseroom in Canvas and transfer them as results (betyg) in Ladok.

Please contact it-support@kth.se if you have questions on how to use the API or if you want to notify some errors in this documentation.

## "Production" and "stage" environments

Canvas and Ladok have test and production environments, and so does Transfer to Ladok API.

We strongly advice you to start using the "stage" environment in your programs, which uses the non-production environments of Ladok and Canvas. That way you can use the API without real students data. Switch to production once your program is ready and you are sure it is working correctly.

The following table shows which environments will be affected when you use either Transfer to Ladok API production or test.

| Transfer to Ladok root                                  | Ladok              | Canvas              |

### A quick note on terminology

In this documentation we will use the word _course_ to refer us to a Canvas course. At KTH we call them "course room" or "examination room"

### Pre-requirements

- You must be teacher or examiner in a Canvas course.
- You must have permissions to write grades (_rättighet-rapportor_) in Ladok.

> **Note**. It is recommended that you have some degree familiarity with REST APIs in general and with Canvas API in particular.

---

## Step 1. Get the Canvas Token and test your configuration

The Transfer to Ladok API uses a Canvas token for authenticating and authorizing you.

Go to [your settings in Canvas](https://kth.test.instructure.com/profile/settings) to get the Canvas token.

Every endpoint in requires an "Authorization" header with the value:

```
Authorization: Bearer <<the canvas token obtained before>>
```

Next, you need a courseroom or examroom ID where you are a teacher. The ID is shown in the URL. For example, the ID `1` corresponds to the course https://kth.test.instructure.com/courses/1.

With such ID, try the following API request:

```
GET /courses/:courseId/sections
```

<details>
<summary>Common solutions if you get as response a status 401 Unauthorized</summary>

### Wrong authorization header

Make sure that the authorization header is `Bearer <access token>`, i.e. the word `Bearer` (with the uppercase "B") followed by a blank space and followed by the access token obtained from Canvas

### Wrong access token

Access tokens are different in Canvas test (https://kth.test.instructure.com) and Canvas production (https://canvas.kth.se). Make sure you have obtained the token from the right environment

### Not enough permissions

Make sure that you are a teacher or examiner in the course you have chosen.

</details>

If you get a status 200, you will get as response a JSON object with two attributes: `aktivitetstillfalle` and `kurstillfalle`. Depending on the course ID, either of the attributes or both will be empty arrays.

| Type of Canvas course                 | `aktivitetstillfalle` array | `kurstillfalle` array |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Examination room                      | non empty                   | empty                 |
| Course room                           | empty                       | non empty             |
| Other types of courses (e.g. sandbox) | empty                       | empty                 |

The elements in the `aktivitetstillfalle` and `kurstillfalle` arrays are possible destinations for your grades, i.e., places in Ladok where you can send grades. Let's choose one of them!

---

## Step 2. Choose a destination

### A. `aktivitetstillfalle` as Destination

If the `aktivitetstilfalle` array is not empty, it will look like this:

```json
{
  "aktivitetstillfalle": [
    {
      "id": "000270d7-ba28-11eb-9e80-39d878524635",
      "name": "EL2520 TEN1 & EL2520 TEN1 - 2021-08-24",
      "date": "2021-08-24"
    },
    {
      "id": "b00e392e-520c-11ec-a5bb-5f5e44dd4232",
      "name": "SF2743 TEN1 - 2022-01-17",
      "date": "2022-01-17"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the example above, you can choose between two different `aktivitetstillfalle`. You need the `id` for it. Use the other fields to ensure that you are selecting the right `aktivitetstillfalle`

### B. Module or final grade in `kurstillfalle` as Destination

If the `kurstillfalle` array is not empty, it will look like this:

```json
{
  "kurstillfalle": [
    {
      "id": "c92efa08-e24c-4803-8a14-20302b4136e9", // (1-A)
      "utbildningsinstans": "2bc9c259-5caa-4278-a4d1-3b754c3fafeb", // (1-B)
      "courseCode": "SF1624",
      "roundCode": "50584",
      "modules": [
        {
          "utbildningsinstans": "ba5cf4b8-093b-446c-9771-5b8835433a84", // (1-C)
          "code": "TEN1",
          "name": "Tentamen"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "23de7f0a-5a09-4510-b2de-c9de0850ff3e", // (2-A)
      "utbildningsinstans": "9fe06003-943f-49eb-bdc8-80d96414f924", // (2-B)
      "courseCode": "SF1624",
      "roundCode": "50581",
      "modules": [
        {
          "utbildningsinstans": "b4e096d0-99ea-43d0-9685-66389b9e5a7d", // (2-C)
          "code": "TEN1",
          "name": "Tentamen"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

As Destination, you will need one `kurstillfalle` ID and one `utbildningsinstans` ID.

- `kurstillfalle` IDs are the ones marked with `(1-A)` and `(2-A)`
- If you want to report **final grades**, choose the `utbildningsinstans` in fields `(1-B)` or `(2-B)`
- If you want to report a **module**, choose the `utbildningsinstans` inside the "modules" list (in this case fields `(1-C)` or `(2-C)`

Examples:

| I want to report...             | `kurstillfalle` | `utbildningsinstans` |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Final grades for SF1624 (50584) | `(1-A)`         | `(1-B)`              |
| Final grades for SF1624 (50581) | `(2-A)`         | `(2-B)`              |
| "TEN1" in SF1624 (50584)        | `(1-A)`         | `(1-C)`              |

Once you got the **destination**, you can continue with the following steps

---

## Step 3. Get a list of gradeable students in a Destination

Request (remember you need either one `aktivitetstillfalle` or a combination of one `kurstillfalle` and one `utbildningsinstans`)

```
GET /courses/:courseId/ladok-grades?aktivitetstillfalle=<<A>>
GET /courses/:courseId/ladok-grades?kurstillfalle=<B>&utbildningsinstans=<C>
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "student": {
      "id": "04bad14a-b5a6-11e7-96e6-896ca17746d1",
      "sortableName": "XXXX, YYYY"
    },
    "scale": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "FX", "F"],
    "hasPermission": true
  },
  {
    "student": {
      "id": "a8ffa877-423f-11e8-8857-bcf89de54ff6",
      "sortableName": "XXXX, YYYY"
    },
    "scale": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "FX", "F"],
    "hasPermission": true
  },
  {
    "student": {
      "id": "f3537b5a-9629-11e8-bf01-45625eef45e2",
      "sortableName": "XXXX, YYYY"
    },
    "scale": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "FX", "F"],
    "hasPermission": true
  }
]
```

Each object represents one student. You need their ID to be able to send results.

---

## 4. Send a result

Request:

```
POST /courses/:courseId/ladok-grades
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "destination": {
    "aktivitetstillfalle": "<< The ID from the first step >>"
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "<< Student ID >>",
      "draft": {
        "grade": "<< Grade for the student. Example: 'F' >",
        "examinationDate": "<< Examination date in YYYY-MM-DD format >>"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "<< Another student ID >>",
      "draft": {
        "grade": "<< Grade for the second student >>",
        "examinationDate": "<< Examination date >>"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Response (if success)

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "success": 2,
    "error": 0
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "df0d839b-b432-11e9-8bbd-25378c5a4e4c",
      "draft": {
        "grade": "B",
        "examinationDate": "2022-05-05"
      },
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "id": "13bf0c2a-b433-11e9-8bbd-25378c5a4e4c",
      "draft": {
        "grade": "F",
        "examinationDate": "2023-05-05"
      },
      "status": "success"
    }
  ]
}
```
